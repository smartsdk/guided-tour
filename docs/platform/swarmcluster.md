# Create your Docker Swarm Cluster

We document here how you can create your Docker Swarm Cluster both in the
FIWARE Lab and in your local development environment (see further below).

## Create your Docker Swarm Cluster in FIWARE Lab

### Register in FIWARE Lab

Fist of all, you need to register at the site
[https://account.lab.fiware.org/](https://account.lab.fiware.org/).
The first time you have to click the “Sing up” button to be redirected to the
Sing up form.

The first time you have to click the “Sing up” button to be redirected
to the Sing up form:

![img](./images/01-create-account-fiware-lab-02.png
"Empty form on Sign up of FIWARE Lab")

Complete the form with your personal data and agree with the FIWARE
Lab Term and Conditions:

![img](./images/01-create-account-fiware-lab-03.png
"Example of form Completion on Sign up of FIWARE Lab")

Complete the registration steps by following the instruction found in
the registration email.


### Configure your cluster

Go to the home page of the [SmartSDK Platform Manager](https://platform-manager.smartsdk.eu/)
and click on “Authenticate with Fiware”.

![img](./images/04-user-first-login-01-platform-auth-01.png
"Home page of SmartSDK Platform Manager")

You will be redirected to the Fiware Lab login page. Insert your credentials.

![img](./images/04-user-first-login-02-platform-auth-02.png
"Fiware Lab Login Page")

Once you login, you need to authorize the SmartSDK Platform to access
your public information in order to create and enable your account.

![img](./images/04-user-first-login-03-platform-auth-03.png
"Fiware Lab Authorization Request")

Then you will be redirected to the SmartSDK Platform as an authorized user.

### Setup Swarm on Fiware Lab

In the SmartSDK platform, depending on what is enabled by the
administrator, you can create your own environment(s).

Once the environment is created, you can add new host(s) in the
environment.

Once a host is added you can deploy your application on it.

Here we document the creation of a “Docker Swarm” environment, with
hosts running on the FIWARE Lab.

First, in the “Environment” tab select the “Manage Environments”.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-01-select-manage-env.png
"Manage Environments Menu")

Then click the “Add Environment” button.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-02-add-new-env.png
"Add Enviroment")

Fill the `Name` and the optional `Description` and ensure the
Enviroment Template is set to `Fiware Swarm`.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-03-new-env-details.png
"Select Swarm as the Enviroment Template")

You will be redirected to the environments list.  Select the newly
created environment and switch to it! (it should now appear selected in the
top-left corner).

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-04-list-envs.png
"Select newly created environment")

In the new environment you will see the list of the users. A warning
at the top of the page will invite you to click on the “Add a host”
link.  Click the link and continue reading.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-05-inside-env.png
"Add host warning")


## Deploy your cluster

Before deploying your cluster you will need to prepare a Security Group in your
FIWARE Lab Cloud to make sure all required ports are open. You need to go to
your [FIWARE Lab Cloud account](https://cloud.lab.fiware.org) in section
"Access & Security".

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-06-add-host-ports.png
"Add new hosts driver selection")

For this demo, you need to have the following rules:

| Protocol | Port  | Notes (just FYI)   |
| -------- |:-----:| :----------------- |
|   TCP    | 22    |  SSH               |
|   TCP    | 80    |  HTTP              |
|   TCP    | 443   |  HTTPS             |
|   TCP    | 2376  |  Docker Swarm      |
|   TCP    | 2377  |  Rancher           |
|   TCP    | 2378  |  Rancher           |
|   UDP    | 500   |  IPSec             |
|   UDP    | 4500  |  IPSec             |
|   UDP    | 4789  |  Docker Swarm      |
|   UDP    | 7946  |  Docker Swarm      |
|   TCP    | 7946  |  Docker Swarm      |
|   TCP    | 1026  |  Orion CB          |
|   TCP    | 8668  |  QuantumLeap       |
|   TCP    | 3000  |  Grafana           |

Now, back to the Platform Manager, in the "Add Host" procedure we can leverage
on the FIWARE Lab Rancher UI driver in order to automatically create hosts on
the FIWARE Lab.

The alternative is for you to have the VMs created outside this platform
manager (for example from your FIWARE LAB ui), get the same Docker version
installed in those VMs and afterwards come here to add such hosts following the
instructions in the "Custom" selection shown in the figure below.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-06-add-host-initial.png
"Add new hosts driver selection")

However, in this guide we will use the recommended FIWARE Lab Option, because
it is much easier (i.e, it creates the VMs for you with required pieces of
software and configurations).

In the initial page select the “FIWARE Lab” driver.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-07-add-host-fiware-lab.png
"Insert FIWARE credentials")

Then insert your FIWARE Cloud Lab credentials.  Please note that those
credential are usually different from the ones used for the OAuth2
procedure. Those credentials are the ones used for the OpenStack
authentication and are the same you would use on the
[cloud lab](https://cloud.lab.fiware.org). Note the username is actually the
complete email address, not your "alias".

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-08-add-host-fiware-details.png
"Select hosts configuration")

If you have more than one region enabled, you can choose where to
create new hosts. Make sure you created the Security Group in the region you
are about to select.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-09-add-host-select-region.png
"Region selection")

Then you need to provide some information regarding the host
configuration you want to deploy. If you have resources for more than one VM,
you can set the quantity accordingly and the VM names will be suffixed by
instance number.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-10-add-host-details.png
"Add hosts configuration details")

The supported configuration requires the following settings:

-   Image: `Ubuntu 16.04 LTS`
-   Flavor: `m1.medium`
-   Security Groups: Select the one you created in the previous steps.
-   Docker Install Url: `https://platform-manager-legacy.smartsdk.eu/install-docker/17.12-smartsdk.sh`
-   Storage Driver: `overlay2`
-   Docker Engine Options: key: `mtu`, value `1400`

To set some of those you will need to expand the "ADVANCED OPTIONS". Your
config should end up looking like the example below.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-11-add-host-mtu.png
"Save hosts configuration")

**Note:** If your OpenStack installation uses a lower MTU than the
de-facto standard of 1500 bytes, you need to configure the Docker
Engine Option properly. The example uses `1400` because it's the one required
for `spain2` region.

At the end of the page then click the “Save” button.

For a few minutes you will see a waiting page. In the background the driver is
starting and provisioning the newly created hosts.

![img](./images/05-user-setup-swarm-13-wait-for-host.png
"Wait for hosts")

## Preparing Portainer

After waiting for a while (usually a couple of minutes) your host(s)
should be in the “active” state.

![img](./images/07-host-added-01-display.png
"Host added")

Follow the “Swarm -> Portainer” menu to start our customized portainer web
interface.

First be sure that in the settings the correct templates are loaded
from the url:
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smartsdk/smartsdk-recipes/master/portainer/templates.json>.

![img](./images/09-portainer-01-settings.png
"Portainer Template Settings")

For SmartSDK recipes, two docker overlay networks named `frontend` and
`backend` need to be create as in the following screenshot. Pay close attention
to include the `com.docker.network.driver.mtu` option with the value of `1400`
if your network requires to reduce the MTU, as is the case of `Spain2` FIWARE
Lab node.

![img](./images/09-portainer-02-network.png "Network Creation")

This ends our web graphical user interface tour. The next section explores the
command-line-oriented tools in case you are interested in working from the CLI.
Otherwise, you are ready to jump to the
[Deploy your platform services](deployservices.md) section.

### Export configuration for Docker CLI

Once the host is up you can export the settings.  The settings are
useful if you want to manage the host using the `docker-machine` tool.
You can also use the setting to connect to the host directly using
`ssh`. Go to "Infrastructure -> Hosts" and click in "Machine Config" as shown
below. Notice the IP address of the host whose config you are downloading.

![img](./images/07-host-added-02-machine-config-download.png
"Add hosts configuration details")

For the ssh connection see the following example. Extract the downloaded
settings file.

    user@localhost tar xvzf h1.tar.gz

    f92db4d8-5b28-44d8-ae54-7fcb823e2e4a/machines/h1/server.pem

Use ssh to connect tho the host and show the running docker containers. Check
the values of your folder name and IP of the host whose config you downloaded.

    user@localhost ssh -i f92db4d8-5b28-44d8-ae54-7fcb823e2e4a/machines/h1/id_rsa \
      -o IdentitiesOnly=yes ubuntu@130.206.126.99 sudo docker ps

## Create your Docker Swarm Cluster on your laptop

In this section we discuss how to create a cluster on your own laptop.

### Prerequisites

To create a swarm cluster on your laptop you need to:

1. Install [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) or any other virtualisation
  solution supported by [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/).

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

1. Install [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/).

1. Install
  [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6)
  (only on Windows).

### Cluster creation

#### Create your cluster on MacOS X or Linux using miniswarm

Once you completed the installation of the above tools, on Linux and MacOS you
can create your cluster using
[miniswarm](https://github.com/aelsabbahy/miniswarm):

1. Download miniswarm:

        $ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aelsabbahy/miniswarm/master/miniswarm -o /usr/local/bin/miniswarm
        $ chmod +rx /usr/local/bin/miniswarm

1. Create a cluster of three nodes (1 master and 2 workers):

        $ miniswarm start 3

1. Connect to your cluster:

        $ eval $(docker-machine env ms-manager0)

If you are interested to explore miniswarm usage:

```bash
$ miniswarm -h
```

#### Create your cluster step-by-step on Windows / Mac / Linux

1. Create 3 docker virtual machines:

        $ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox ms-manager0
        $ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox ms-worker0
        $ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox ms-worker1

1. Check that the virtual machines are correctly deployed:

        $ docker-machine ls

        NAME          ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                          SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
        ms-manager0   *        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376            v18.02.0-ce
        ms-worker0    -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.101:2376            v18.02.0-ce
        ms-worker1    -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.102:2376            v18.02.0-ce


1. Initialise the swarm cluster (adjust to your manager IP):

        $ docker-machine ssh ms-manager0 "docker swarm init --advertise-addr <ms-manager0-ip>"
        Swarm initialized: current node <node ID> is now a manager.

    To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

        $ docker swarm join --token <token> <ms-manager0-ip>:<port>

    To add a manager to this swarm, run (and follow the instructions)...

        $ docker swarm join-token manager


1. Add the workers to the swarm using the token provided by the swarm manager:

        $ docker-machine ssh ms-worker0 "docker swarm join \
        --token <token> \
        <ms-manager0-ip>:<port>"
        $ docker-machine ssh ms-worker1 "docker swarm join \
        --token <token> \
        <ms-manager0-ip>:<port>"

1. Connect to your cluster:

        $ eval $(docker-machine env ms-manager0)

### Test your cluster

1. List nodes in your cluster:

        $ docker node ls
        ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS
        w697ke0djs3cfdf3bgbrcblam *   ms-manager0         Ready               Active              Leader
        fw2ajm8zw4f12ut3sgffgdwsl     ms-worker0          Ready               Active
        z69rvapjce827l69b6zehceal     ms-worker1          Ready               Active

1. Launch a docker service:

        $ docker service create --name helloworld --restart-condition=none alpine ping -c 4 docker.com

        sm3hi368lbsxye3n2rgdwv5xo
        overall progress: 1 out of 1 tasks
        1/1: running   [==================================================>]
        verify: Service converged

1. Check the service logs (Quit with ctrl+C)

        $ docker service logs -f helloworld
        helloworld.1.k5jtv8w7zyu2@ms-manager0    | PING docker.com (54.209.102.157): 56 data bytes
        helloworld.1.k5jtv8w7zyu2@ms-manager0    |
        helloworld.1.k5jtv8w7zyu2@ms-manager0    | --- docker.com ping statistics ---
        helloworld.1.k5jtv8w7zyu2@ms-manager0    | 4 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss

1. Remove the service (don't leave it pinging)

        $ docker service rm helloworld
        helloworld
